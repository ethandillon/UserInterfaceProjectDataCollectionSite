# üé¨ Movie Reco### Sprint 1 ‚Äì Setup & Infrastructure (1 week)
- [x] **Req 1.1:** Initialize Vite + React project structure  
- [x] **Req 1.2:** Install dependencies (React Router, Axios for API calls, Tailwind/styling library)  
- [x] **Req 1.3:** Configure environment variables (TMDB API key & sheet.best endpoint)  
- [x] **Req 1.4:** Set up GitHub repo + deployment pipeline (Vercel/Netlify)  
- **Deliverable:** Running "Hello World" React app deployed onliner A/B Test ‚Äì Requirements & Sprint Plan

## üìã High-Level Goal
Build a static **Vite + React** web app that:  
1. Collects student **name + ID**  
2. Runs a **movie recommendation experiment (A/B test)**  
   - **Group A:** static recommender (movies don‚Äôt change)  
   - **Group B:** ‚Äúadaptive‚Äù recommender (after a selection, new movies from the same genre appear)  
3. Records **interaction data + survey answers** in a **Google Sheet (via sheet.best)**  
4. Shows a **debrief/explanation screen** at the end
